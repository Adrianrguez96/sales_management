- **Client Management**: Add, update, and remove client information, ensuring accurate records for sales and marketing.
- **Manufacturer Management**: Manage manufacturer details, including the ability to create, modify, and delete records.
- **Sales Management**: Efficiently track and manage sales transactions within the store.
- **Realistic Barcode Generation**: Each product includes a realistic barcode, generated using a specific factory code assigned to each manufacturer, reflecting real-world practices.

## System Requirements

- **Python**: The latest version of Python is required to run the application.
- **Qpython Library**: This application utilizes the Qpython library for GUI components.
- **SQLite3**: Built-in support for SQLite3 is used for database management.
